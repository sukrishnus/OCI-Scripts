# OCI-Scripts
This repository contains scripts relating to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure APIs.

Prior to running a script, you need install the appropriate OCI SDK (e.g. python). See the OCI documentation (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm) for details on how to install SDKs for your environment. 
Additonally, all scripts in this repository require an OCI config file in the default .oci folder in the user's HOME directory. 
Refer to the following OCI documentation for instructions on how to create/setup a config file and generate 
the reqired key and fingerprint files: https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm
