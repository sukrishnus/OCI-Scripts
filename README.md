# OCI-Scripts
This repository contains scripts (SDKs, CLI etc) relating to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

All the scripts require an oci config file in the user's HOME directory. 
Refer to the following OCI documentation for instructions on how to create setup a config file and generate 
the reqired key and fingerprint files: https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm
